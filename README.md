# LazyCommands

First of all, thank you for taking interest in my small and very simple project.
The purpose of this app is very straight forward: to be able to run a couple windows commands in your machine whenever you press a button from your phone.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JoaquinGomez1/LazyCommands
$ cd LazyCommands
$ npm install && cd client && npm install
$ npm run build
$ cd .. && node createService
```
